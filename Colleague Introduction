Hi!
My name’s Jarryd Wedgewarth. I’ve just joined the graphis department as an adobe
specialist.
I’ll be getting in touch with influencers, bloggs, and vloggs to increase our online presense.
If you see a new face around, well, that’s me :) We can chat about cyberpunk literature, video games,
and downhill mountain biking.
Cheers!
Jarryd Wedgewarth
PS The sweat treats in the kitchen are all for you!
